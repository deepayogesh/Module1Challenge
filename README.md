# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
	Louise wants to start her crowdfunding campaign to fund her play "Fever". We have to analyze data within the theater and play category, and help her set up a goal. 
## Analysis and Challenges
	Organize and analyze crowdfunding data and utilize graphs to visualize present data better in order to set up her goal.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
# year derived from id column."Date Created Conversion" this column not present in xlsx. Tried hidden column too.

	I derived the year from the ID column first, but then realized that I needed the month for the next step. So, I chose to derive the year and month from the launch date. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	A higher range of goals shows more fluctuations in success rates. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	The only difficulty that I faced was that it took me some time to get the correct syntax to write the COUNTIFS function.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	1. If the goal is between the range of 1000 to 25000, percentage of success rate was more stable.
	2. If the goal is greater than 25000, percentage of success rate was unstable.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	For a successful campaign, the goal should range in either 30000 to 34999 or 40000 to 44999. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	More sample data could get better picture to decide on goal.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	Other possible graphs we could create include the observation of crowdfunding project success by country.
